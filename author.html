    <h1>Jane Austen</h1>
    <p>
        Born December 16, 1775 in Hampshire, England as the seventh child of her family, Jane austen
        is one of the most renowned and widely read English novelists of all time. She is primarily 
        known for her novels that interpret and critique the gentry. Her major works include Sense 
        and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion.
        She leaves behind Sanditon, a novel with 11 full chapters and a 12th incomplete chapter. Unfortunately, 
        Sandition was never completed due to Austen's passing in 1817.

        Jane Austen was not only a brilliant author but a political symbol of early feminism. Many suffragists 
        used Austen as a rebel and role model in the first wave of feminism. Her works are not considered "feminist"
        in the way that we may consider it today, but they did discuss the need for equality between sexes as her
        heroines are known to defy societal norms and advocate for their right to choose their life. Feminism 
        portrayed by Jane Austen's work is not about dominating men but about women who demand equality and autonomy
        in a society that is dominated by the patriarchy.

        Jane Austen's fascination with the world of literature began quite early in her life. During her 
        adolescence, she began to write her own novels with her first being Love and Friendship, a romantic 
        fiction parody formed as a series of love letters. Her second, The History of England, was a thirty 
        four page parody of historical writing about England with thirteen water color miniatures done by her 
        sister, Cassandra included. Later on, Austen made fair copies of her earlier works in bound notebooks 
        containing novels, poems, short stories, and plays which are referred to as Jane's Juvenila today. In 
        1789, she began to write longer and more sophisticated novels. From 1796 to 1797, Austen had been 
        occupied with writing her second book, First Impressions. The first draft of First Impressions was 
        completed in 1797 when she was 21 years old. First Impressions would be later published as Pride and 
        Prejudice.
