            Published in 1813, Pride and Prejudice is a classic romance novel by renowned author, Jane Austen.
            The story is set during the Regency era in rural England and follows the Bennets, a family made up
            of a noisy mother, eccentric father, and five very unique daughters. The second eldest daughter,
            Elizabeth, is known to be the clever and high spirited heroine. The development of her relationship
            with the wealthy yet socially awkward aristrocrat, Fitzwilliam Darcy is the central focus. Initially, 
            their impressions of each other had been unfavorable due to both character's hasty pride and judgements.
            However, as the story of this classic continues to unfold, the two begin to overcome their distaste for each
            other and grow to understand one another's true character.

        Though the concept of reputation comes up a lot throughout the novel, there is a heavy focus on how a woman is
        expected to present herself to the world. Elizabeth is known to be a woman who refuses to adhere to the societal
        standards that are pushed onto women as she is stubborn and refuses to marry for any reason other than love, which
        causes her to clash with her mother who desires nothing more than to marry her daughters off. The themes of Pride 
        and Prejudice are one of the most appreciated aspects of the novel as Austen artistically weaves together the themes
        of limitations imposed by social class, overcoming judgement, love transcending societal expectations and social barriers,
        and family and sisterhood. As the title suggests, Elizabeth must overcome her prejudice and Darcy must set his pride aside.
