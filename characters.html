    <h1>Elizabeth Bennet</h1>
    <p>The second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth is the heroine and her father's favorite as 
        they share similar  opinions on society's conventions and the importance of wealth and status. 
        Elizabeth is the most intelligent of her sisters as she is witty with a tongue that others percieve
        as too sharp for her own good. She is one of the most well known female characters in English literature.
    </p>
    <h1>Fitzwilliam Darcy</h1>
    <p>
        Mr. Darcy is the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Though he is judgmental towards
        those that are of the lower classes, he is a shy gentleman which makes him come across
        as cold and prideful. Like Elizabeth, he also tends to judge harshly and hastily with 
        his wealth playing a role in his excessive pride. Elizabeth's rejections to his 
        proposals builds humility in Darcy as he continues to demonstrate his devotion to her.
    </p>
    <h1>Jane Bennet</h1>
    <p>
        Jane is the eldest sister who is considered to be the fairest by her mother. She 
        is gentle and reserved, her pleasantness in her interactions with Charles Bingley
        contrasts with the mutual distase between Elizabeth and Darcy 
    </p>
    <h1>Charles Bingley</h1>
    <p>
        Bingley is Darcy's best friend. His easygoing nature contrasts with Darcy's 
        initially prideful and haughty demeanor as he is uncaring about differneces
        due to social class.
